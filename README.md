Hello!

Thank you to everyone who has contributed here on Github. Today I begin a project that I have neglected to initiate for a long time. My objecive is to learn as much as possible about coding, application development, blockchain technology, artifical intelligence, machine learning, virtual/augmented/mixed reality among, and many more areas of technology. I look forward to working on a great project and welcome the opportunity and privilege to collaborate with anyone who may be interested at somepoint. Cheers!

Sincerely,
